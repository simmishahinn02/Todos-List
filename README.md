# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
to run this project, we need to install npm modules by running the command npm install in the terminal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`



### `npm test`


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
